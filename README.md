Photon
======

Photon is an optics-based puzzle game I've been developing using JavaScript and [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/). The graphics are handled entirely using [SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/), which provides crisp and clean visualizations at any resolution. The goal of each level is to arrange the mirrors, filters, and prisms provided to guide the correct colored beams of light to the corresponding colored goals. Currently the game runs entirely on the client machine, but I plan to add persistence across browser sessions and users in the future.
